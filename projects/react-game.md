# Project - React Game

### Introduction

You've now learned enough React to create a game! This project is to practice fundamentals of React: components, props, and state.

### General guidelines for projects:

You are welcome to rewrite the game you made last week in React or make a different one.

Here are some [examples](https://bg.reactjs.org/community/examples.html). **Please do not select hangman because of its racist origins.**

Note: You can start this app in codeSandbox, codePen, replit.com, etc. You do not yet know how to run React apps locally, but will learn that throughout this week of the curriculum and can move your game then if you like.

### Primary Goals

1. Understand what a React component is (and why they're reusable), as well as how to create an instance of one
2. Start developing an understanding React props and state

Stretch goal: try managing data using Props and State with different instances of the same reusable component

### Minimum Requirements

- Write a game of your choosing in React
- Make sure you practice components, props, and state
  - Have some sort of input that you receive from one component that you pass to another (such as number of tries, hi/low number, etc.)
  - Have some sort of counter that uses the useState hook to update the score or count to the screen
- Commit your code at least 15 times
- Submit at least 1 PR by the end of the week

#### Extension Activity

If you have extra time, consider [hosting your game on GitHub Pages](https://betterprogramming.pub/how-to-host-your-react-app-on-github-pages-for-free-919ad201a4cb).
